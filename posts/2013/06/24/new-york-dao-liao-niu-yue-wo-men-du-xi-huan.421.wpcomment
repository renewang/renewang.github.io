Dear lioness!<br /><br />You know "the Gate"!! Finally! Someone could identify it! haha! I was so lucky that when I first went to New York, "the Gate" was showing in central park back then. Your sister and you were so funny! Love the story about you two! <br /><br />Oh! I finally finished your book "不讓你看見我的眼淚"  (sorry it took me so long! And now I need to catch up your new one! :D) Compared to "your New York" filled with the moments of your sister&#39;s struggle, mine is just mundane and plain. Now when I saw the photo of "the Gate" taken at that time, I wish everyone who had watched the exhibition is happy and healthy now.  Best! :)
