Dear Rene:<br /><br />When I saw the photo of "the Gate","Dame!" I said, (forgive my language), because I was so wanting to go there at that time, but I got a terrible cold. And my artist sister kept telling me that " Oh, it&#39;s just some weird project, not worth coming la." Ok, then one Sunday morning I got a phone call from her:" Sis, guess where I am?! Under the Gate!! It is AWESOME!" I hang up on her!!! Man, oh man. I am so envious whoever went to that "weird art project", I hope they got to do another one and this time I am not going to miss it! I so heart NY!! So are you going?
