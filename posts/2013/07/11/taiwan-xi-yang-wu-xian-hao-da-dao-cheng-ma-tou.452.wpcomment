Dear Rene:<br /><br />I think this place maybe my favorite corner of the whole Taipei city, last night I went there for a bike ride, incredibly beautiful! I, too, am waiting for the movie to come up, may go for the first show!! Haha. Love your photos, wish I could be that good one day. Happy summer.
