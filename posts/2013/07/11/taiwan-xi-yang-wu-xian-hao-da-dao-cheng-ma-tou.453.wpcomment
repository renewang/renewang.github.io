ï¼ lioness,<br /><br />You are so lucky that you live in that neighborhood. It indeed is a beautiful place to relax and you can enjoy the most beautiful sunset within a short bike ride distance. Hey, you have your eyes and genuine heart to appreciate the nature beauty which is more important than any photo skills. I can imagine how you put this beautiful scene into touching words as you always do. <br /><br />Glad to know you also like this movie. Must share your thoughts after finishing the first show. Best! :)
