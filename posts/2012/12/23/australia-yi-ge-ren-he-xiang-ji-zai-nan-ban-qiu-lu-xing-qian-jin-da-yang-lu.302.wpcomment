Thank you for your kind compliments! There are still a lot of things I need to learn! I did make some of my photos into postcards. That&#39;s because I needed to make a gingerbread man postcard for my friends&#39; second child (story for 1st child: http://renewangtw.blogspot.tw/2011/12/post-card.html) and the print company only could accept the deal with a set of eight. <br /><br />I sent one of them to you. Should be on its way to your house now. :)<br />Merry Christmas! I&#39;m glad to know you too!
