Wow, that&#39;s awesome that you got to see Keane!! I want to write a love story about this song, ( sadly, that&#39;s the only song I know of them, "somewhere only we know") maybe I should listen to more of their songs! Funny thing on the way back today from commuting, I found myself enjoying listening to David Tao, haha. And just realized that once I really liked his songs and listened to them more often than I expected.
